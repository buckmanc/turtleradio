Play music on whatever bluetooth device can be paired with.

Run `connect-and-play` on your Linux machine, or use `update` to set up a dedicated Raspberry pi. Tested on Ubuntu, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

Defaults to the [1987 TMNT theme](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4csk52). Because what else would you want to play?
